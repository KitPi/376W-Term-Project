# Term Project Version control

Be sure to let everyone know that you are working on the project files before downloading and making changes to the files.
ONLY ONE person can edit the project files at a time. (Or we risk the wrath of Git Merge issues)

1. Announce you are working on the project files on Discord. Make sure no one else is editing them at the same time.
2. Download the .twee file
3. Go to https://twinery.org/2/#/
4. Import the .twee file: Library -> import -> choose file...
5. Make changes to the story.
6. Export to .twee file: Build -> export to twee file -> in your Downloads folder.
7. Upload to .twee file to github: Upload Files -> add commit message -> Done :slight_smile:
8. Let everyone know you are done editing.

If you are having trouble upload the .twee file to Discord with Time edited and Name in the filename: e.g. "376W Project Name Jan 1st 0940.twee"
